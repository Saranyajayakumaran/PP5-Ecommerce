- **Project Setup**
    - **Create a Project:** Use django-admin startproject projectname to create a new Django project.
    - **Create an App:** Within the project, use python manage.py startapp appname to create a new application.

- **Project Structure**
    - **Manage.py:** A command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project.
    - **Settings.py:** Configuration for your Django project (database settings, installed apps, middleware, etc.)
    - **Urls.py:** URL declarations for the Django project; maps URLs to views.
    - **Wsgi.py:** Entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

- **Models**
    - **Define Models:** Define your data models in models.py using Django’s ORM.
    - **Migrations:** Create migrations using python manage.py makemigrations and apply them with python manage.py migrate.

- **Views**
    - **Define Views:** In views.py, define the functions or classes that handle requests and return responses.
    - **Templates:** Use HTML templates to render views. Templates are stored in the templates directory.

- **URLs**
    - **URL Configuration:** In urls.py, map URL patterns to views. Include app-specific URLs using Django’s include() function.

- **Forms**
    - **Create Forms:** Use Django’s forms library to handle form rendering and validation.
    - **Handle Forms:** Process forms in views, validate inputs, and handle errors.

- **Static Files**
    -**Static Files:** Store CSS, JavaScript, and images in the static directory and serve them using Django’s static file management.
